## About the Book
This book features techniques and real implementations of machine learning applications on Android phones. This 
book covers various developer tools, including TensorFlow and Google ML Kit. 

The book begins with a quick review of android application development fundamentals and a couple of Java and Kotlin implementations developed using the Android Studio integrated development environment. The book explores TensorFlow Lite and Google ML Kit, along with some of the most widely used machine learning techniques. The book covers real projects on TensorFlow, demonstrates how to collect photos with Camera X, and preprocess them with the Google ML Kit. It explains how to onboard the power of machine learning in Android applications that detect images, identify faces, and apply effects to photographs, among other things. These applications are constructed on top of TensorFlow models – some of which were created and trained by the reader – and then converted to TensorFlow Lite for mobile applications.

After reading the book, the reader will be able to apply machine learning techniques to create Android applications and take their applications to the next level. This book can be a successful tool to deep dive into Data Science for all mobile programmers.
